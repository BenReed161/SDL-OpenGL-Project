A coding project which implements SDL2 as a window manager and uses OpenGL for the accelerated graphics. The project also crrently uses Dear ImGUI as a basis for a seperate "editor" program.
Originally I wanted this to be a simple game engine/game editor, however now I'm just experimenting with OpenGL, GLSL, and UI tools to learn more about graphics and render pipelines.
